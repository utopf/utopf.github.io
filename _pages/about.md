<p style="text-align: justify;">
Protein homeostasis is crucial for accurate cellular function and secures the health of an organism. Protein homeostasis is based on the well-adjusted cooperation between protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Each of these fundamental cellular processes can be regulated at multiple steps to adjust the biogenesis of proteins to the current requirements of the cell. 
Maintenance of a correctly folded proteome strongly depends on the efficiency of a network of surveillance mechanisms. However, little is known about why these mechanisms fail during aging. 
Utilizing yeast and the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the pioneering model organism in aging research, we want to identify limitations in the proteostasis network that lead to proteostasis collapse during aging. Our long-term goal is to better understand the complex crosstalk within the proteostasis network. This will allow the development of novel interventions that alter or even ameliorate health deficits during aging.
